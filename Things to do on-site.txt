Things to do on-site

1) Clarify on the types of PPE gear worn by staff. (Are jumpsuits considered as safety vest? Some staff do not wear safety vests. Do different locations have different rules in wearing PPE?)

2) Look for potential locations to set CCTV cameras. These cameras should not be allowed to pan or zoom.

3) Find out where is the walkway.

4) Discuss with them to identify what forklift movement is considered a forklift operation.

5) Discuss with them to identify what conditions need to be fulfilled to consider an area to be unauthorised.

6) What is the period of time within a day should the model run. (Daytime only or does detection also triggers at night)

7) Search for a temporary location where we can set up a camera to take videos in the hanger to set up (hopefully we can footage of workers working)

8) Discuss if we can get updated footages every week of the hanger (preferably when there is boat maintenance)

9) Take pictures or videos of oil drums storage, general workers with PPE, boats and forklifts during operation
 
10) Discuss with them to identify types of vehicles that considered illegally parked.
